G-PhoCS
=======

G-PhoCS is a software package for inferring ancestral population sizes, population divergence times, and migration rates from individual genome sequences. G-PhoCS accepts as input a set of multiple sequence alignments from separate neutrally evolving loci along the genome. Parameter inference is done in a Bayesian manner, using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to jointly sample model parameters and genealogies at the input loci.
